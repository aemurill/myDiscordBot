Reminder: Only admins can use `config`!
Use `admin set <option> <value>` to set options.
    options include:
        prefix: how do we call the bot?
        reqrole: what role is needed to access admin commands for the bot?
Use `admin botban <user>` to ban someone from using the bot.
Use `admin unbotban <user>` to undo that.
Use `admin default` to reset the bot!
